# BancoRepeatChecker
From a list of draw result of Loto-Qu√©bec's lottery "BANCO", study the repetitive numbers in a draw from the previous one.

The application was created on my brother's request.
We've already made other simlar program in the past.

Application was written and tested in Delphi 10.4 Rio.

This was the original purpose and from where the application name is coming from.  
Now, something has been added where one may enter his own number(s) and then check how many matching numbers are using the past draws.
